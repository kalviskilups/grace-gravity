# GRACE Gravity Anomaly Detection

This repository provides the code for detecting and analyzing gravity anomalies using data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites.

## Overview
GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites measure Earth's gravity field variations. These measurements help identify anomalies caused by mass redistributions such as groundwater changes, ice sheet dynamics, and tectonic activities.
